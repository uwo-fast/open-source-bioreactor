# TODO

## model completeness / enhancement

- [ ] finish modelling peri pumps and integrating with a motor then into the assembly using the peri pump motor mount that has been modified to take the registered parameters for the motor and pump
- [ ] replace as many of the "generic" parameter registrations as possible with specific ones for the actual hardware (i.e. mcmaster carr part numbers or best effort for other parts)
- [ ] give `gearbox_36pg_5p18` an input recess that actually receives the motor's boss and shaft
  - it models its input as one `[22, 3]` bore, so the boss (8 x 3) and shaft (2 x 8) on `motor_36pg_3530_5p18` intersect the gearbox body instead of seating in it; fine while it is only visualisation, wrong once anything keys off that interface

## nice to haves

- [ ] Add curve / inflection point to holes in bayonet connectors to grip tubes better
  - sehan's idea, currently they grip really tight already so this is just a thought for improving the design if we find the tubes are slipping out too easily in testing; or if we wanted to reduce the interference fit and make it easier to insert the tubes in the first place while keeping them from slipping out
- [ ] optional end styles (sensor gland) for atlas probes to match product more closely

## second hardware revision

- [ ] use a less expensive shaft for the impeller and try and get in 300mm instead of oversized 400mm thats being compensated by the parameteric printed motor mount
  - might not need to be linear motion surface rated and all that
- [ ] swap out the threaded rods with printed parts
